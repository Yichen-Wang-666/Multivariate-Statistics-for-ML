## Heart Disease Prediction
### Project Description
This project is aiming to predict the occurrence of the heart disease based on different clinical features such as age, sex, blood pressure and so on based on a dataset provided on
Kaggle, which includes over 11 common features, making it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. To do such prediction, data cleaning and feature
selection will be implemented at first using both PCA analysis and feature importance from random forest to filter out certain less-contributing predictors. After that, both regression
modelling and boosted forest modelling will be implemented to compare their accuracies. By constructing and training a reliable model, this project could help the researchers to identify
the potential threat from heart disease at an early stage and keep threats from potential patients.
