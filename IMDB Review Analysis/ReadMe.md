## IMDB Review Analysis
### Project Description:
The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model that projects the critic rating (variable name: imdb_score) of the movie based on the IMDb (an online
database for all film-related information) dataset. The dataset, with 46 predictors, contains various movie attributes such as the budget of the movie, its duration,
and genre, allowing for data analysis and model building. At the completion of the project, the team will use the final model to predict the IMDb rating of 40
blockbusters with the expectation of testing the accuracy and usefulness of the model.
