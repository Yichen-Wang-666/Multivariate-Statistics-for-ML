## Case Description
Among all the customers who landed on Arteaâ€™s website, the proportion of those who
actually made a purchase is much lower than they expected even though the
engagement metrics indicate nothing wrong. Therefore, in order to solve this situation
and improve the revenue generated, the CEO of Artea is considering incentivizing
purchases via distributing discounted coupons to registered users. Since this strategy
may potentially backfire and destroy the profit margins by encouraging potential
customers to only buy on discounts, A/B testing is used to test the effect of this potential
strategy.
